# Afterlight Edge — Build Status

**Updated:** 2026-07-20 · Companion to `05_ROADMAP.md` (this tracks *actual* progress).

## Milestones

| Milestone | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** Foundation | ✅ Done | Scaffold, Drizzle schema (10 tables) + migration, Auth.js, seed, CI, design tokens |
| **M1** Ingestion | ✅ Done | `kalshi` client (HTTP + fixture), `ingest`/`settle` jobs, `pipeline_runs`, Runs page, Opportunities (market data), market detail + price chart |
| **M2** Enrichment | ✅ Done | `news` (Tavily+GDELT+fixture, dedup, relevance), `llm` (sonnet-5 + fixture, versioned prompt, zod, retry-once, cost), `enrich` job + budget guard; reasoning + cited news on detail. **Manual-only** |
| **M3** Scoring | ✅ Done | Pure `scoring` (fees, blend, edge, longshot guard, tiers, ranking, Kelly caps) ≥90% branch cov; `score` job; full Opportunities table + edge gauge + actionability rule; verdict + signal breakdown; Settings writes new config_versions |
| **M4** Calibration | ✅ Done | Pure `calibration` (Brier, log loss, 10-bin calibration curve, paper PnL, category/tier slices) 100% stmts / 98% branch; Track Record page (headline metrics, curve chart, empty state); 3 Playwright E2E flows (login, opportunities, market detail) all passing against Neon; `docs/RUNBOOK.md` |

**MVP complete.** See `05_ROADMAP.md` → Post-MVP backlog for what's next (weight re-fit workflow, WebSocket streaming, base-rate breadth, more sources, multi-user).

## Deployment

- **Live:** `afterlight-mu.vercel.app` (Vercel Hobby). Deploys from `main`.
- **DB:** Neon Postgres (pooler URL), migrated + seeded. No schema changes since M0 → no pending migrations.
- **Repo:** `github.com/drs556/afterlight`.

## Runtime modes (env-selected)

| Dependency | Live when set | Else |
|---|---|---|
| Kalshi | `KALSHI_API_KEY_ID` + `KALSHI_API_PRIVATE_KEY` | fixtures (bundled sample markets) |
| News | `TAVILY_API_KEY` (+ free GDELT) | fixtures |
| LLM | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | fixtures |

Env vars set on Vercel today: `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `CRON_SECRET`. Admin login: `javiergerardo7@gmail.com`.

## Known gaps / to verify

1. ~~**Kalshi live client unverified**~~ ✅ **Verified 2026-07-22.** RSA-PSS signing + pagination confirmed against the real API (1,299 open markets, valid cursor). Found and fixed a real spec-drift bug in the process: Kalshi's API now returns dollar-string price fields (`yes_bid_dollars`, etc.) instead of the legacy integer-cents fields the schema expected — see `docs/03_DATA_SOURCES.md §1`. `runIngest()` itself has not yet been run against production Neon (writes ~1,300 rows) — do that as the next live check.
2. **Cron cadence** — Hobby = once/day (ingest 12:00, score 12:30, settle 13:00 UTC). Sub-daily needs Vercel Pro (snippet in README). `enrich` intentionally off-cron.
3. ~~**Costs** — `docs/COSTS.md` not yet created~~ ✅ **Created 2026-07-22** (`docs/COSTS.md`, verified pricing). Only enrich spends (Anthropic ~$0.033/assessment on `claude-sonnet-5`, Tavily 1 credit/market), budget-guarded at $10/day, manual-only.
4. **48h gapless snapshots (M1 accept)** — runtime property; needs Pro cron or manual runs to satisfy.

## Cost posture

- **Fixture mode / free jobs only:** ~$0.
- **Full live:** ~$120–310/mo (dominated by Anthropic), per `03 §5`.
- Rotate the Neon password + `AUTH_SECRET` at some point (they appeared in the build chat).
